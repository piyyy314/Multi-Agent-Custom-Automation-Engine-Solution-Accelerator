"""
Human-in-the-loop MCP tool — ask_user.

Provides an ``ask_user`` tool that any domain agent can call to request
clarification from the human user.  The tool POSTs the question to the
backend's ``/api/clarification/ask`` endpoint, which relays it over WebSocket
to the browser and blocks until the user responds (or times out).

The answer is returned as a plain string — the agent continues with it
in context like any other tool result.
